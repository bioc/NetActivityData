\title{Weights of GO_KEGG model trained with GTEx samples}
\format{
A matrix with 1518 rows (gene sets) and 19423 columns (genes). Colnames and rownames
include gene set and gene names.
}
\description{
We trained a shallow sparsely-connected autoencoder using GO biological processes
and KEGG pathways as gene sets. The model was trained using all the GTEx samples
(in total 7,729 samples for training). The matrix contains the weights obtained
after training the model. Dimensions of the matrix correspond to the number of
genes in the original matrix (19,423 genes) and the selected gene sets (1,518 gene
sets). Although the weights sign is arbitrary, genes not included in a gene set have
a weight of zero. Rownames correspond to gene set names (either GO term id or KEGG pathway
id) while colnames correspond to the genes' ENSEMBL id.
